The dataset that will be used is from SDOT Traffic Management Division, Traffic Records Group of Seattle, Washington. We will analyze the effects of whether 
conditions on accidents from 2004-2020. To train the model the following attributes that will be used consist of the accident location and address type, severity, 
collision type, number of people involved in the accident, number of vehicles involved, weather conditions, the date and time, road conditions, fatalities, 
crosswalks, and speed.

Data preparation will be performed to balance the labeled data, transform data, fill missing data, and clean the dataset prior to finalizing the dataset to be 
fed into the modeling tools.
