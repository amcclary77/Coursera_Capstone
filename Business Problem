Business Problem


In Seattle, Washington, there are specific intersections and blocks that are prone to accidents during specific weather conditions. The objective of this plan is 
to explore the type and severity of an accident at these intersections and blocks from 2004-2020. The accidents arenâ€™t limited to car crashes; they also include 
Pedestrians walking and Pedalcyclists. If people are aware of the likelihood of getting into an accident, they can decide whether or not to take a different 
route or wait for the weather conditions to improve.
